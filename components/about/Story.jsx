        Since I was a child, I started{" "}
        <strong className="text-blue-400">building</strong> things. At first I
        built all sort of toys and models with legos. Then I started learning
        drawing, I particularly liked drawing architecture. After I entered high
        school, I became the captain of our video and photography team. I made a
        lot of videos and album for a variety of school events.

        Because I like science, in particular, medicine and pharmacology, I went
        into one of the top pharmacy school and the world and studied an
        integrated master degree of{" "}
        <strong className="text-blue-400">pharmacy</strong>. I graduated with a
        first class honour, and worked as a trainee pharmacist. After 5 years of
        education, I finally became a <strong className="text-blue-400">registered pharmacist</strong>.

        My working experience in pharmacy sparked my interest in software
        development. I worked at one of the largest healthcare companies in the
        UK, only to discovered many of their software applications were fairly
        out-of-date. It was slow and lack UI and UX design. It inspired me to
        build applications one day, which could effectively improve patient
        treatment journey, and empower more efficient provision of healthcare
        services.

        During my full-time job as a{" "}
        <strong className="text-blue-400">trainee pharmacist</strong>, I spent
        most of my spare time and weekends learning coding. I began with taking
        a full stack <strong className="text-blue-400">Udemy</strong> course
        taught by Angela Yu. Then I started to build projects following Youtube
        tutorials.

        In summer 2021, I officially completed my five-year pharmacy education.
        I decided to come back to Hong Kong to learn web development. I joined H
        Academy's <strong className="text-blue-400">full stack web development bootcamp</strong>. Since then I started becoming more familiar
        with Javascript and a wide variety of web technologies and libraries.
